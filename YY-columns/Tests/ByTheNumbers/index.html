	<h1>Guinness World Records</h1>
	<p>If something can be measured, Guinness World Records can point you to the most-extreme cases. The official record keeper has gathered more than 40,000 records that range from the serious (widest river) to the silly (farthest arrow shot with the feet, shown at right). These records celebrate extraordinary human feats as well as extremes in the natural world. New records are set all the time. But if there’s a record-breaking feat you’ve been practicing, Guinness World Records Day on November 20 is a good day to attempt it!</p>
