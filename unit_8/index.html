			<p><span class="number">INSULAR</span> Like a revolving door, everything goes in circle. Like the dog who bites its tongue, the mind regurgitates and then recycles everything again. A never ending process with some elements that sift throught the mesh. LIke the feathers of a dead chicken that flies for miles and lands in unexpected places. <span class="italic">Circular water</span> see Virgilio Piñera</p>

				<p><span class="number">SURVIVAL</span> Is it fundamental to our survival the idea that THINGS exist? or is it more important that they <span class="italic">actually </span>exist? To some, there is abundance. THose who will find the source of their lacking. To others, there is scarcity. Those who have too much of the same and nothing else.</p>

			<h3>CREATE AN EXPERIENCE</h3>
			<p>Is that what everything will come to? The Cuban Experience. How many things are exportable? The warmth? the innocense? the vitality of survival? Are people really that blind? Or is it just a complete lack of reference? Are we karmical condemned to TRADE? The new conquistadores.</p>
